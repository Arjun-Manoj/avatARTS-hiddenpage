    <h2>Stakeholder Problem Analysis</h2>
    <p>Before creating avatARTS, we wanted to ensure our platform solves real challenges for our users — both art enthusiasts and fashion lovers. We conducted surveys and informal interviews with potential customers, artists, and production partners to understand their pain points.</p>

        <tr><td>2</td><td>Artists wanted assurance of proper attribution and fair licensing.</td><td>Developed clear attribution labels and revenue-sharing model.</td><td>Builds trust and long-term artist partnerships.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>Users preferred separate sections for browsing art and customizing clothing.</td><td>Structured site with distinct Art Gallery and Customization pages.</td><td>Improves navigation and reduces overwhelm.</td></tr>

    <h2>Philosophy — The Story Behind avatARTS</h2>
    <p><strong>Phase 1 – The Art Lover’s Dilemma</strong><br>
    You adore art. You also love fashion. But every time you try to blend the two, you either get low-quality prints or generic designs. You want to wear something that feels like you — authentic, expressive, and connected to the art you love.</p>

    <p><strong>Phase 2 – Enter avatARTS</strong><br>
    Instead of scrolling endlessly through mass-produced designs, imagine a single platform where you can browse iconic artworks, customise them on clothing, and preview them on avatars that look like you. Artists get fair credit, users get creative freedom, and art gets a new life.</p>

    <p><strong>Phase 3 – Why We Built It This Way</strong><br>
    We studied how fashion customisation platforms operate, and realised that while they focused on style, they often neglected authenticity, inclusivity, and respect for the art itself. avatARTS combines these elements — giving users creative tools while safeguarding artistic integrity.</p>

    <p><strong>Phase 4 – Future Expansion</strong><br>
    Our vision is to make avatARTS a hub for wearable art globally. Future additions could include augmented reality try-ons, collaborations with museums, and exclusive artist collections. We aim to expand internationally, tailoring the experience for cultural preferences and fashion sensibilities across regions.</p>
